This is the code I demonstrated in my talk "iOS 5 UIViewController containment" at iPhoneDevCon 2011.

Peter's example is awesome for learning this stuff! I updated the code and slimmed it down to a minimum:

* use a Storyboard instead of a .xib file
* don't @synthesize
* use lazy instanciation
* a custom initializer for SampleView
* removed all methods that don't do anything
* fixed some typos
