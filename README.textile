This sample demonstrates how to use the new view controller containment APIs in iOS 5
to create your own UIViewController containers. This is the code I demonstrated in my talk
"iOS 5 UIViewController containment" at iPhoneDevCon 2011. Slides for this talk are online
at "Speaker Deck":http://speakerdeck.com/u/peterfriese/p/ios-5-uiviewcontroller-containment.
